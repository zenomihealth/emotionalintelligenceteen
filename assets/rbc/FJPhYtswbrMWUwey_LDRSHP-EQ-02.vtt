<v ->How do you feel right now?</v>

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.430
Are you overwhelmed or stressed?

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.150
Do you feel happy or relaxed?

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.103
Were you aware of that emotion before I asked the question?

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.860
Those with high self-awareness

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.690
frequently check in with themselves

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.350
to evaluate their emotional state.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.300
They can recognize and label their feelings,

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.990
know why they're experiencing those emotions,

10
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.150
and can understand how those feelings

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.993
influence their behavior and impact others.

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.240
It's an important skill.

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.300
So let's take a look at the three types of self-awareness,

14
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.890
why self-awareness is so necessary,

15
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.990
and how you can you can develop the skill.

16
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.000
There are three types of self-awareness.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.750
First, there's emotional self-awareness,

18
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680
which is about being aware of your emotions.

19
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.310
You notice how you're feeling,

20
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.850
and you can recognize how that's influencing

21
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.540
your thoughts, actions, and performance.

22
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.770
Second, there's accurate self-assessment,

23
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.260
which is the ability to understand your emotional strengths,

24
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.760
weaknesses, and limitations.

25
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640
For example, you might know

26
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.310
that you tend to yell when frustrated.

27
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.820
Finally there's self-confidence,

28
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.440
which comes from knowing yourself

29
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.570
and your emotional tendencies.

30
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.460
Those with high self-confidence

31
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.233
don't let unpredictable events rattle them.

32
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.830
Emotions can be overwhelming.

33
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.150
And without strong self-awareness,

34
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.640
they can unintentionally control our decisions,

35
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.190
influence our actions,

36
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.170
and negatively affect our performance.

37
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.040
Let's take a look at those downsides.

38
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.730
The first downside of low self-awareness

39
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.020
is that you might be prone to emotional outbursts.

40
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.070
That's because if you push your feelings down,

41
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.680
you'll only bottle them up.

42
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.367
And then it only takes one thing to send you off the edge.

43
00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.710
Second, without strong self-awareness,

44
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.670
you might be prone to impulsive decisions.

45
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.720
Rather than exploring your emotions

46
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.530
or thinking things through,

47
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.520
you'll take immediate action.

48
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.080
For example, if you're excited,

49
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.380
you might let that enthusiasm get in the way

50
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.410
of logical reasoning.

51
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.510
Third, if you're not aware of your emotions

52
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.370
and their influence,

53
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.540
you might be prone to unpredictable behavior.

54
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.050
Thus allowing your emotions to run you,

55
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.440
rather than the other way around.

56
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.590
For example, you might be kind to others

57
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.280
when you're in a good mood,

58
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.723
and lash out at people when you're upset.

59
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:41.710
So how can you improve your self-awareness?

60
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.550
Here are some tips you can follow.

61
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.330
The first tip for improving your self-awareness

62
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.850
is to feel and accept your emotions.

63
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.450
Focus on them, give them names,

64
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.710
and let them run their course.

65
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.820
Regularly ask yourself, how do I feel right now?

66
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.180
And why am I choosing that label?

67
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.360
Second, keep a reflective journal.

68
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.090
At the end of the day, write down what happened,

69
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.810
how those events made you feel, and how you reacted.

70
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.710
That will allow you to identify your emotional triggers

71
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.319
and spot patterns.

72
00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.970
Third, notice your physical reactions.

73
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.640
We often store emotions in our body.

74
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.030
So make a habit of performing regular body scans

75
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.540
when you're relaxed, stressed,

76
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.290
or feeling any other type of emotion.

77
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.780
Fourth, reflect with what questions.

78
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.100
Try to figure out what causes strong emotions for you.

79
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.460
For example, after a big event you might ask,

80
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.090
what about that experience made me nervous?

81
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.680
Or what did this situation

82
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.880
have in common with past experiences?

83
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.150
Finally, seek regular feedback.

84
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.090
To understand more about yourself,

85
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.090
it's also important to see how others view you.

86
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.720
For example, you might think you're assertive,

87
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.290
while others may see that, your behavior, as bullying.

88
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.563
So get second opinions.

89
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.870
Remember these tips and keep practicing.

90
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.840
Make a commitment to recognizing how you're feeling,

91
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.460
and how those feelings are influencing others.

92
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.403
And you can cultivate greater self-awareness.
